This project is currently in it's beginning stage. Currently, it only offers a more advanced search for finding tennis players.
Using their tournament data and how well they play, the website will eventually be able to display the likelihood of them accepting a scholarship from UNC Charlotte to play tennis here. 

We are currently waiting on data from the UNC Charlotte tennis coach for a test set to compare this data with.
The data will be compared using Weka (http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/) 

This website is currently being hosted at: http://64.137.210.107:8080/JavaServerFaces/

The server is rather slow and there's a large amount of data, so please be patient when filtering. It also accepts multiple filters.
